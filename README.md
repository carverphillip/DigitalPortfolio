# DigitalPortfolio
As a upcoming college graduate, I would like to continue in the IT field to become a Systems Engineer. I am currently a System Administrator but would like to become a Systems Engineer with a background in Python, Powershell, and SQL to help with running any automated scripts for any servers. For my portfolio, I would like to have a few different web developing projects to show case my diversity within the IT field so that I can multiple hats if need be.
