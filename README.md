# DigitalPortfolio
As a upcoming college graduate, I would like to continue in the IT field to become a Network Engineer. I am currently a System Administrator but would like to practice a little more in web developing to help with my little brother's non profit. For my portfolio, I would like to have a few different web developing projects to show case my diversity within the IT field so that I can wear multiple hats if need be.


I also would like to give a special thanks to David Vega. His coding was inspirational towards the completion of my final project.
